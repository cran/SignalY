\title{Select Variables Based on Shrinkage}
\usage{
select_by_shrinkage(hs_fit, threshold = 0.5, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{hs_fit}{Object returned by \code{\link{fit_horseshoe}}.}

\item{threshold}{Kappa threshold. Variables with kappa < threshold are
considered relevant. Default 0.5.}

\item{verbose}{Logical for messages.}
}
\value{
List with selected variable names and details.

\description{
Variable selection method using shrinkage factors (kappa).
Note: This method may underselect when tau collapses to small values.
Consider using \code{\link{select_by_credible_interval}} as an alternative.
}
\seealso{
\code{\link{select_by_credible_interval}} for a more robust alternative.
